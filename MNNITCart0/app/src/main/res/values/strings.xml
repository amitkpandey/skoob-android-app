    <string name="about_app_para">skoob is desigend and developed by Oxpecker for Avishkar 2017.
        Avishkar is the annual TechFest of MNNIT, Allahabad.
        Oxpecker is a one member team.\nThe app is a simple e-commerce app for exchange of books
        in the institute using mutual skoins as well as money. Instead of direct money transactions
        on the fly we seal a deal with the seller and the buyer just needs to pay the money while
        receiving the book from the seller. Using skoins lets you buy
        books from the skoins earned through selling used books. This way students can
        completely avoid the use of money in exchange of books. We infact offer all new customers
        with 50 skoins! So what are you waiting for, start skoobing!
